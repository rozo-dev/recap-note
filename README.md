# What is Recap?

Recap is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application designed to make note-taking simple, organized, and visually appealing. It allows users to create, manage, and categorize notes efficiently, making it ideal for daily journaling, task tracking, or idea collection.

This is my first full-stack MERN project, and it demonstrates modern web development practices including authentication, state management, and API integration.

# Features

Recap provides the following functionality:
Create, Edit, and Delete Notes: Quickly capture your thoughts or tasks and update them as needed.
Collections: Organize notes into collections for better categorization.
Add/Remove Notes in Collections: Group related notes together and manage them easily.
Visual Enhancements: Each note can display a background image fetched from the Unsplash API to make your notes visually appealing.
Authentication & Security: User login and session management powered by Passport.js for secure access.
Global State Management: Uses React Context API to manage global state efficiently across the app.

# Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Context API, TailwindCSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: Passport.js
